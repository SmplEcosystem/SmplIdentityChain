    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Smpl DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the DID specification
        currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and
        DID method specifications, please see the <a
                href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md"

        Smpl is a public ledger designed specifically for privacy-preserving
        self-sovereign identity.

    <h2>Smpl DID Method </h2>
    <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>smpl</code></p>
    <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:smpl</code>.
        Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
        is the NSI specified below.</p>

    <h2>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h2>
    <p>
        The Smpl DID scheme is defined by the following <a
            href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt">ABNF</a>:<br><br>
        <code>
            smplrin-did = "did:smpl:" idstring *(":" subnamespace)<br>
            idstring = 21*22(base58char)<br>
            subnamespace = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-")<br>
            base58char = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" / "C"<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q"<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" / "a" / "b" / "c"<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p"<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"<br>
        </code><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
    <p>The 128-bit uuid underlying a Smpl DID can be generated in various ways--using standard uuid methods.
    </p>
    <p>A convenient regex to match <code>smpl</code> DIDs is: <br><br>
        <code>^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}$</code><br><br>
        A convenient regex to match the entire did string is:<br><br>
        <code>^did:smpl:[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}(?&lt;namespace&gt;(?::\w[-\w]*)*)$</code>
    </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>A valid <code>smpl</code> DID might be: <code>did:smpl:2wJPyULfLLnYTEFYzByfUR</code>.</p>

    <h2>JSON-LD Context Definition</h2>
    <p>On Smpl, public DIDs and their corresponding documents are stored on the ledger.</p>

    <h2>CRUD Operation Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
    <p>
        The DID method specification must specify how a client creates a DID record—the combination of a DID and its
        associated document—on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of
        ownership.

    </p>

    <h4>DID Service Endpoint</h4>

    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <h4>DID Service Endpoint</h4>

    <p>When reading (resolving) a Smpl DID, in addition to querying the DID record, a query MUST be performed for a
        related DID Service endpoint.
